## API Documentation

To get started with integrating the Ripple Payments Direct API, refer to our official documentation:

- [Ripple Payments Direct Documentation](https://docs.ripple.com/payments-direct-2/api-docs/getting-started)


## Navigating SDKs by Version

Our SDKs are organized by Git tags, and each tag corresponds to a specific version of the OpenAPI specification. This structure ensures that you can always work with SDKs that are compatible with the exact version of the Ripple Payments Direct API you’re integrating with.

## Tag Structure

When you check out a specific tag (e.g., v0.0.1), the repository will contain the following directory structure:
```

├── openapi_spec/   ← Contains the OpenAPI specification used for this version
└── sdks/           
    ├── java/       ← Java SDK
    ├── python/     ← Python SDK
    ├── typescript/ ← Typescript SDK
    └── go/         ← Go SDK

```

## Why This Matters

- Tags give you a reproducible and stable snapshot of SDKs + API definition.
- Enables consistent integration and debugging across environments.
- Helps ensure your application is using the correct version of the Ripple Payments Direct API.
